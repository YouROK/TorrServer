# Authentication

The users data file should be located near to the settings. Basic auth, read more in wiki <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication>.

`accs.db` in JSON format:

```json
{
    "User1": "Pass1",
    "User2": "Pass2"
}
```

Note: You should enable authentication with -a (--httpauth) TorrServer startup option.
